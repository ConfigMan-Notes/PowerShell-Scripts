# Introduction
This is my repository for scripts that I share. I use Visual Studio Code to edit these.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
    This is where I keep scripts I use in my Blog. I try to keep them updated and current,
    but nobody's perfect! I'm learning how to use the GitHub features, so please let me know if you
    have any recommedations or suggestions. 

    I'm also a self-taught scriptor, so if you see something I could do better in a different way, please
    let me know!
